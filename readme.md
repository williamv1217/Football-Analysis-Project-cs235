# Football Prediction Analysis

We used events from 10,000 football games to do analysis on how teams played and create an algorithm to predict the results of future games.

## Getting Started

We are using python3. The libraries we have used are: pickle, numpy, sklearn, plotly, and pandas. We got our dataset from Kaggle.

## For Grader:

We are using python3. 

The libraries we have used are:

pickle
numpy
sklearn
plotly
pandas

How to run:
In main directory "project", run "python3 main.py" from terminal.


I tried to make a "makefile" but couldn't get it to work for python
(I've only made it for C before)


We have included our dataset, merged.csv
We have included a folder of basic input feature lists
These lists are for the remaining games for Chelsea for the 2018/19 season
We have also included the graphs that we made, they will be called when you run the program as well.


Thank you,
